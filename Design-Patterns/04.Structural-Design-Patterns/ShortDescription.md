## Creditional Design Patterns
*In software engineering, structural design patterns are design patterns that ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships between entities.*

**Examples:**
## Adapter pattern
*An adapter helps two incompatible interfaces to work together. This is the real world definition for an adapter. Interfaces may be incompatible but the inner functionality should suit the need. The Adapter design pattern allows otherwise incompatible classes to work together by converting the interface of one class into an interface expected by the clients.*
